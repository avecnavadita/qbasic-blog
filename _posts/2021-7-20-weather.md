## Introduction
This program clarifies the weather according to the value given by the user.

## Algorithm
1. Start
1. Ask for a value
1. Check if the weather is less than equal to 10 and if the condition is true print whatever is written on line number 39
1. Check if the weather is less than equal to 20 and if the condition is true print whatever is written on line number 42
1. Check if the weather is less than equal to 30 and if the condition is true print whatever is written on line number 45
1. Check if the weather is less than equal to 40 and if the condition is true print whatever is written on line number 48
1. Check if the weather is less than equal to 51 and if the condition is true print whatever is written on line number 51
1. Check if the weather is greater than equal to 51 and if the condition is true print whatever is written on line number 54
1. If the conditions are not true than print whatever is written in line number 58
1. Add a book mark (GOTO)
1. End

## Program 
```
RREM "-------"
REM "Weather"
REM "-------"

PRINT "Weather Forecast"

PRINT

INPUT "Enter your choice"; weather%

START:
CLS

IF weather% <= 10 THEN
    PRINT "It's freezing cold today, go sit near a heater or get comfy in the blanket"

ELSEIF weather% <= 20 THEN
    PRINT "It's kinda cold :/"

ELSEIF weather% <= 30 THEN
    PRINT "It's beautiful weather today :)"

ELSEIF weather% <= 40 THEN
    PRINT "The weather is hot today"

ELSEIF weather% <= 50 THEN
    PRINT "It's too hot, get yourself an AC!!"

ELSEIF weather% >= 51 THEN
    PRINT "Global Warming"

ELSE
    PRINT "I hope you enjoyed the weather game :)"

END IF

PRINT

INPUT "Next temperature please"; weather%

GOTO START
```

## Description

**GOTO statement**
The GOTO statement sends the procedure to a line label or a line number in the program.

Example :

```
PRINT "first":
GOTO HERE

HERE:
PRINT "second"

3 END  
```
This will print
```
first
second
```
